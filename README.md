# Hi there ðŸ™Œ

This organization is focused on researching ways to leverage AI for automating the case investigation process within a Security Operations Center (SOC). It examines widely used open-source SOC technologies and their integration for incident response. These SOC technology stacks will be used in the development process of the AI system. Developing local frontend/backend for customization and public services for demonstration are the final goals of the research.
